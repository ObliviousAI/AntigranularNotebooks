Based on Omer Yentur's [solution](https://www.antigranular.com/notebooks/66a1f94c019ee6315e603829), Omer used own scaler instead of the standard_scaler function. Using standard_scaler function introduces randomness based on the value of epsilon (the lower epsilon value gives more randomness). Hence, implementing your own scaler will increase the performance dramatically as Omer Yentur did.\n","2. The cutoff for predictions was 0.5 for this notebook. There may be better cutoff value than 0.5.\n","3. More layers will result in better performance, as Mosbeh Barhoumi's [solution](https://www.antigranular.com/notebooks/66a2118a019ee6315e62023e) and Ala Ammari's [solution](https://www.antigranular.com/notebooks/66a21447019ee6315e6239ce) show. They both used epsilon value of 0.9, lower than mine, and used neural network with more layers.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-hNf-bVJt7yx"}}]}
